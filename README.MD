# Return of Mario Bros.: English Translation

## About
This repository manual resources for an English translation of Kaettekita Mario Brothers for the Famicom Disk System.

It contains the original scans, a blanked version, and a typeset version. Huge thanks to Sho from [Gaming Alexandria](https://www.patreon.com/gamingalexandria) for providing a manual scan for this game. It wasn't uploaded to the site as he said it didn't quite meet the site's quality standards (which, to be fair, is a very high bar).

The source code for the translation is located at [return-of-mario-bros-fds-en](https://github.com/romh-acking/return-of-mario-bros-fds-en).
